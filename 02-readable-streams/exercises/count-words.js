  Exercise

  Write a function that receives a stream and counts the number of words in the stream.
  Be careful that in a chunk you might receive a word that is currently truncated, so
  try to figure out how to reconcile words spanning 2 chunks.

export default async function countWords (srcStream) {
  // ... implement here the logic to count the number of words in the stream
  // ... return the actual number of words when the stream is finished
  return 0
